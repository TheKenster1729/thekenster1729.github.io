											<h2>Bio and Background</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello internet, my name is Kenny, and I'm from West Haven, CT (currently living in Cambridge, MA). I work as a research assistant at the
											<a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/">MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change</a>, where I study scenario discovery and
											its application to climate models. Scenario discovery is a framework for making decisions under highly uncertain futures, and is especially
											relevant to policymakers looking to make robust decisions (which should be all policymakers, in theory).
											<br></br>											
											An easily
											excited individual, I enjoy learning about new things and thinking about the world. On a less abstract level, I am fond of 
											nature, talking with people, music (listening to it, and playing it via the guitar, piano, and ukulele), books, cooking, and an
											assortment of other items and activities. Please make yourself at home, and don't forget to
											and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">drop a like and subscribe</a>.

										<h3>1.063 - Introduction to Fluids and Diseases, Spring 2020</h3>
										<p>Applied principles of disease modeling learned in this course to build <a href = "documents/1.063 Final Project Report.pdf"> my own COVID-19 model </a> to predict disease burden in Suffolk County, MA.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/18.065 photo.PNG" alt="" /></span>
										<h3>18.065 - Matrix Methods, Spring 2020</h3>
										<p>Studied the use of linear algebra in modern applications (e.g. machine learning) and produced <a href = "documents/18_065_Final_Project.pdf"> a Markov model for random music generation </a>.</p>

										<h3>8.226 - 43 Orders of Magnitude, Spring 2022</h3>
										<p>This unique class covered major achievements of science engineering and their benefits and risks, including the development of agriculture, the industrial revolution, nucler power, AI, pandemics,
											and the search for aliens.<a href="documents\final_paper_8226.pdf">My final paper</a> discussed the impact of individual dietary choices on greenhosue gas emissions.</p>

										<h3>Undergraduate Association Committee on COVID-19, Fall 2020 - Spring 2021</h3>
										<p>Worked with students, student leaders, and administrators to identify and solve student body problems that arose in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, I led a team that focused on understanding MIT public health policy to enhance student decision-making capabilities, and then I co-led a team that advocated for expansion of the number and variety of on-campus spaces that were available for students to work in.</p>

										<h3>Scenario Discovery with the MIT EPPA Model, January 2021 - Present </h3>
										<p>Using the EPPA climate model, I study which input factors have the largest impact on the climatologically important output factors (e.g. carbon emissions). 
											A first round of results from similar research has been published under <a href = https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021EF002239>"Representing Socio-Economic Uncertainty in Human System Models"</a> (Earth's Future),
											and a second round on my current work is being drafted with the title <a href="https://globalchange.mit.edu/publication/18092">Application of Scenario Discovery Techniques to Probabilistic Ensembles in Exploration of Energy Futures</a>.
											Through a collaboration at Tufts University, I am also an author on a paper currently in review titled "Compounding uncertainties in economic and population growth increase tail risks for relevant outcomes across sectors".

										<h3>Dynamics of Homologous Recombination in <em>S. Pombe</em>, June 2017 - August 2018</h3>
										<p>Worked in the lab of Megan King in the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine (Yale School of Medicine) under graduate student (now Dr.) Amanda Vines and studied the mechanism of homologous recombination (a DNA repair technique) in yeast. The work in the lab led to <a href = https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E20-07-0433>a paper on our results</a>. Image credit: MicrobeWiki</p>
